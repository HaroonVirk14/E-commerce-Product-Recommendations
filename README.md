## Shopping Trends Analysis and Recommendation System Evaluation

This repository contains Python code for analyzing shopping trends and evaluating recommendation systems using data from a retail dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization of customer demographics and purchasing behavior, and implementation of a collaborative filtering recommendation system using the Surprise library.

### Key Features:

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Item Purchased) using LabelEncoder for machine learning compatibility.
  - Standardized numerical features (e.g., Age, Purchase Amount) using StandardScaler for uniform scaling.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing distributions of customer demographics, purchase frequencies, and payment methods.
  - Analyzed popular items, categories, and seasonal purchasing trends through bar plots, histograms, and box plots.

- **Recommendation System Evaluation:**
  - Implemented the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm from the Surprise library.
  - Evaluated system performance metrics including RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), precision, and recall to assess recommendation quality.

### Repository Structure:
